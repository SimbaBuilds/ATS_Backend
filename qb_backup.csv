The expression $\frac{4}{x-5} - \frac{1}{x+1}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{4}{x-5} + \frac{-1}{x+1}$. To add the two terms of this expression, the terms can be rewritten with a common denominator. Since $\frac{1}{x+1}=1$, the expression $\frac{4}{x-5}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{4(x+1)}{(x-5)(x+1)}$, the expression $\frac{-1}{x+1}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{-1(x-5)}{(x+1)(x-5)}$. Therefore, the expression $\frac{4}{x-5} + \frac{-1}{x+1}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{4(x+1)-1(x-5)}{(x-5)(x+1)}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{4x+4-x+5}{(x-5)(x+1)}$.

This means that the slope of line $r$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $p$. If the equation for line $p$ is rewritten in slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, then $m$ is the slope of the line and $0, b$ is its y-intercept.

Let x represent the total number of items in the box. It follows that \frac{37}{100}x, or 0.37x, items in the box are green. It's also given that of those, 37\% are also rectangular. Therefore, \frac{37}{100} \times 0.37x, or 0.1369x, items in the box are green rectangular items. It's also given that of the green rectangular items, 42\% are also metal.

If the system has no solution, what is the value of $p$?","The correct answer is 6. A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the $xy$-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, $Ax + By = C$ and $Dx + Ey = F$, are parallel if the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning $\frac{A}{D} = \frac{B}{E}$ and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning $\frac{C}{F}$ is not equal to $\frac{A}{D}$ or $\frac{B}{E}$. The first equation in the given system is $\frac{3}{2}y - \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{2}y$. Multiplying each side of this equation by 2 yields $18y - 3x = 8 - 18y$. Adding 18 to each side of this equation yields $36y - 3x = 8$, or $-3x + 36y = 8$. The second equation in the given system is $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{3} = p\left(y + \frac{3}{2}y\right)$. Multiplying each side of this equation by 2 yields $x + 3p = 2y + 9p$. Subtracting 2p from each side of this equation yields $x + p = 2y + 9p$. Subtracting 3 from each side of this equation yields $x - 2py = 6$. Therefore, the two equations in the given system, written in standard form, are $-3x + 36y = 8$ and $x - 2py = 6$. As previously stated, if this system has no solution, the lines represented by the equations in the $xy$-plane are parallel and distinct, meaning the proportion $\frac{-3}{1} = \frac{36}{-2p}$ is true and the proportion $\frac{8}{6}$ is not true. The proportion $\frac{-3}{1} = \frac{36}{-2p}$ is true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, $\frac{-3}{1} = \frac{36}{-2p}$, by $-18$ yields 6 $= p$.

Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by contrast, argued that while some Spanish inﬂuence is undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the product of the ongoing interactions of various cultures in Mexico and the United States. Which finding, if true, would most directly support Paredes’s argument? type of poem originating in late sixteenth-century Spain. social life—of a clearly recent origin.","Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Paredes’s argument that Mexican- American folklore is mostly the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an adaptation of Spanish folklore. The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultures there have interacted. The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward.

Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because “singular” means extraordinary, not acceptable.

If the equation of the parabola is written in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants, which of the following could be the value of $a + b + c$?","Choice D is correct. The equation of a parabola in the xy-plane can be written in the form $y = ax^2 + k$, where $a$ is a constant and $k$ is the vertex of the parabola. If $a$ is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if $a$ is negative, the parabola will open downward. It's given that the parabola has vertex $\(9, -14\)$. Substituting $9$ for $h$ and $-14$ for $k$ in the equation $y = ax^2 + h$ gives $y = ax^2 - 9x - 14$, which can be rewritten as $y = ax^2 - 18ax + 81a - 14$. Therefore, the equation of the parabola, $y = ax^2 - 18ax + 81a - 14$, can be written in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a = a, b = -18a,$ and $c = 81a - 14$. Substituting $-18a$ for $b$ and $81a - 14$ for $c$ in the expression $a + b + c$ yields $a + -18a + 81a - 14 = 64a -14$. Since the vertex of the parabola, $9, -14$, is below the x-axis, and it's given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant $a$ must have a positive value. Setting the expression $64a - 14$ equal to the value in choice D yields $64a -14 = -12$. Adding 14 to both sides of this equation yields $64a = 2$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 64 yields $a = \frac{1}{32}$, which is a positive value. Therefore, if the equation of the parabola is written in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants, the value of $a + b + c$ could be $-12$.",D,"{'A': '$-23$', 'B': '$-19$', 'C': '$-14$', 'D': '$-12$'}"

It's given that triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $DEF$, where $A$ corresponds to $D$, so the measure of angle $A$ is equal to the measure of angle $D$. Therefore, if $\tan(A) = \sqrt{3}$, then $\tan(D) = \sqrt{3}$. It's given that angles $C$ and $F$ are right angles, so triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are right triangles. The adjacent side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the adjacent side of angle $D$ is side $DF$. The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle $D$ is side $EF$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, $\tan(D) = \frac{EF}{DF}$. If $DF = 125$, the length of side $EF$ can be found by substituting $\sqrt{3}$ for $\tan(D)$ and 125 for $DF$ in the equation $\tan(D) = \frac{EF}{DF}$ which yields $\frac{EF}{125} = \sqrt{3}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 125 yields $125\sqrt{3} = EF$. Since the length of side $EF$ is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of side $DF$, it follows that triangle $DEF$ is a special right triangle with angle measures $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, $DE$, is 2 times the length of side $DF$, or $DE = 2DF$. Substituting 125 for $DF$ in this equation yields $DE = 2 \times 125$ or $DE = 250$.

It's given that a square is inscribed in a circle and the length of a radius of the circle is $20\sqrt{2}$ inches. Therefore, the length of a diameter of the circle is $2 \times 20\sqrt{2}$ inches, or $40\sqrt{2}$ inches. It follows that the length of a diagonal of the square is also $40\sqrt{2}$ inches. A diagonal of a square separates the square into two right triangles in which the legs are the sides of the square and the hypotenuse is a diagonal. Since a square has 4 congruent sides, each of these two right triangles has congruent legs and a hypotenuse of length $40\sqrt{2}$ inches. Since each of these two right triangles has congruent legs, they are both 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg. Let $s$ represent the length of a leg of one of these 45-45-90 triangles. It follows that $20\sqrt{2} = s \sqrt{2}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $\sqrt{2}$ yields $20 = s$.

Therefore, the acute angles of triangle $JKL$ are angle $K$ and angle $L$. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $JKL$ is side $KL$. The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that $\cos(K) = \frac{24}{51}$. This can be written as $\cos(K) = \frac{n}{17}$. Since the cosine of angle $K$ is a ratio, it follows that the length of the side adjacent to angle $K$ is $8n$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $17n$, where $n$ is a constant. Therefore, $JK = 8n$ and $KL = 17n$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For triangle $JKL$, it follows that $JK^2 + JL^2 = KL^2$. Substituting for $JK$ and $JL$ yields $8n^2 + JL^2 = 17n^2$. This is equivalent to $64n^2 + JL^2 = 289n^2$. Subtracting $64n^2$ from each side of this equation yields $JL^2 = 225n^2$. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields $JL = 15n$.

When the graph of an equation in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A, B, and C$ are constants, is translated down $k$ units in the xy-plane, the resulting graph can be represented by the equation $Ax + By + k = C$. It's given that the graph of $9x - 10y = 19$ is translated down 4 units in the xy-plane. Therefore, the resulting graph can be represented by the equation $9x - 10y + 4 = 19$, or $9x - 10y = 15$. Adding 40 to both sides of this equation yields $9x - 10y = 59$. The x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the graph of an equation in the xy-plane is the value of $x$ in the equation when $y = 0$. Substituting 0 for $y$ in the equation $9x - 10y = 59$ yields $9x - 100 = 59$, or $9x = 59$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields $x = \frac{59}{9}$.

It's given in the table that the coordinates of two points on a line in the $xy$-plane are $(k, 13)$ and $(k + 7, -15)$. The $y$-intercept is another point on the line. The slope computed using any pair of points from the line will be the same.

Substituting $-4$ for $m$ and the coordinates of the points $(k, -5, b)$ and $(k,13)$ into the slope formula yields $-4 = \frac{13 - (-5)}{k - k}$, which is equivalent to $-4 = \frac{13 + b}{0}$, or $-4 = \frac{13 + b}{1}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 5 yields $-20 = 13 - b$. Subtracting 13 from both sides of this equation yields $-33 = -b$. Dividing both sides of this equation by -1 yields $b = 33$.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the $x$-$y$ plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, $Ax + By = C$ and $Dx + Ey = F$, are parallel if the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning $\frac{A}{D} = \frac{B}{E}$ and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning $\frac{C}{F}$ is not equal to $\frac{A}{D}$ or $\frac{B}{E}$. For the given equation, $y = 6x + 18$, it can be written in the standard form by subtracting $6x$ from both sides of the equation to yield $-6x + y = 18$. Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A = -6$, $B = 1$, and $C = 18$.

The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili.

The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorous—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don’t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don’t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.    Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn’t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock.

Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species.

The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated    some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.",B,"{'A': 'Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to', 'B': 'some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by', 'C': 'Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within', 'D': 'the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted'}"

It's given that the area of the original poster is 360 square inches. Let $l$ represent the length, in inches, of the original poster, and let $w$ represent the width, in inches, of the original poster. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, it follows that $360 = lw$. It's also given that a copy of the poster is made in which the length and width of the original poster are each increased by 20%. It follows that the length of the copy is the length of the original poster plus 20% of the length of the original poster, which is equivalent to $l_0 + \frac{1}{5}l_0$ or $1.2l_0$ inches. This length can be rewritten as $l + 0.2l$ inches, or $1.2l$ inches.

It's given that $x = 6k + 13$ and $y = 8k - 29$. Substituting $6k + 13$ for $x$ and $8k - 29$ for $y$ in the equation $x = y$ yields $6k + 13 = 8k - 29$.

In the text, the arts journalist asserts that Enwezor wished not just to focus on modern African artists but also to show “how their work fits into the larger context of global modern art and art history,” or how their work relates to artistic developments and work by other artists elsewhere in the world. The description of Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965 indicates that Enwezor and Siegel’s exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history.    Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn’t support the arts journalist’s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists fit into the larger context of global modern art and art history.

It follows that $f$ can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + kx + h$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$, where $y = f(x) + 4$. Substituting $ax^2 + kx + h$ for $f(x)$ in this equation yields $y = ax^2 + kx + h + 4$. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$, where $h + 4$ is either the maximum or the minimum value of $y$, which occurs when $x = h$. For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$. The table shows that $x$-values of $21$ and $25$ correspond to the same value $y$, $-8$. Since $23$ is halfway between $21$ and $25$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at an $x$-value of $23$. The table shows that when $x = 23$, $y = 8$. It follows that $h = 23$ and $k + 4 = 8$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation $k + 4 = 8$ yields $k = 4$. Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = ax^2 + kx + h$ yields $y = ax^2 + 4x + 23$ or, $y = ax^2 + 4x + 19$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any $x$-value and its corresponding $y$-value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $-8 = a(25)^2 + 4(25) + h$, or $-8 = a(25)^2 + 4(25) + h - 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $-16 = a(25)^2$ or $-16 = 625a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $625$ yields $a = -4/625$. Substituting $-4/625$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = ax^2 + kx + h$ yields $y = -4/625x^2 + 4x + 23$. The $y$-intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the $xy$-plane is the point on the graph where $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation $y = f(x) = ax^2 + kx + h$ yields $y = 0 - 4/625x^2 + 4x + 23 + 4$.

In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs have equal lengths, and the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times the length of one of the legs. Let $l$ represent the length, in inches, of each leg of the isosceles right triangle. It follows that the length of the hypotenuse is $l\sqrt{2}$ inches. The perimeter of a figure is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the figure. Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles right triangle is $l + l + l\sqrt{2}$ inches. It's given that the perimeter of the triangle is $94 + 94\sqrt{2}$ inches. It follows that $1 + 1 + l\sqrt{2} = 94 + 94\sqrt{2}$. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields $l + l\sqrt{2} = 94 + 94\sqrt{2}$, or $2l + l\sqrt{2} = 94 + 94\sqrt{2}$.

Applying the distributive property to the numerator and to the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation yields $l = \frac{188 - 94\cdot 2}{4 - 2}$, which is equivalent to $l = \frac{94}{2}$, or $l = 47\sqrt{2}$.

If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison’s time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House’s published authors, thus supporting the scholar’s claim.

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to active multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes’ antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-ﬂower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are diﬃcult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing eﬃcient and effective mosquito repellents.

Substituting 144 for $x$ in this equation yields $f(144) = 4 + \sqrt{144}$. Since the positive square root of 144 is 12, it follows that this equation can be rewritten as $f(144) = 4 + 12$, or $f(144) = 16$.

Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of the given equation, $x(x + 1) - 56$, yields $x^2 + x - 56$. Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of the given equation, $4x(x - 7)$, yields $4x^2 - 28x$. Thus, the equation becomes $x^2 + x - 56 = 4x^2 - 28x$. Combining like terms on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields $0 = 4x^2 - x - 28x + x - 56$ or $3x^2 - 29x + 56 = 0$. For a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the quadratic formula gives the solutions to the equation in the form $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

In the triangles shown, angle $R$ and angle $U$ are both marked as right angles, so angle $R$ and angle $U$ are corresponding angles.

Since $\overline{PR}$ and $\overline{QS}$ are diameters of the circle shown, $\overline{OS}$, $\overline{OR}$, $\overline{OP}$, and $\overline{OQ}$ are radii of the circle and are therefore congruent. Since $\angle SOP$ and $\angle QRO$ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arcs $\overline{PR}$ and $\overline{QS}$ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, $\angle SOR$ and $\angle POQ$ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arcs $\overline{SR}$ and $\overline{PQ}$ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let $x$ represent the length of arc $\overline{SR}$. Since arc $\overline{SR}$ and arc $\overline{PQ}$ are congruent arcs, the length of arc $\overline{PQ}$ can also be represented by $x$. It's given that the length of arc $\overline{PS}$ is twice the length of arc $\overline{PQ}$. Therefore, the length of arc $\overline{PS}$ can be represented by the expression $2x$. Since arcs $\overline{PS}$ and arc $\overline{QR}$ are congruent arcs, the length of arc $\overline{QR}$ can also be represented by $2x$. This gives the expression $x + x + 2x = 144\pi$. Since it's given that the circumference is $144\pi$, the expression $x + x + x + 2x$ is equal to $144\pi$. Thus $x + x + 2x = 144\pi$, or $6x = 144\pi$.

For the circle in the xy-plane with equation $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 16$, it follows that $r^2 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $r = 4$ or $r = -4$.

It's given that the owner pays $4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays a total of $4.90s + 11.60l$ dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90s + 11.60l \leq 2,200$. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, $s + l \geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90s + 11.60l \leq 2,200$ and $s + l \geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting $l$ from both sides of the inequality $s + l \geq 200$ yields $s \geq 200 - l$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $4.90$ yields $4.90s \geq 4.90(200 - l)$, or $4.90s \geq 980 - 4.90l$. Adding $11.60l$ to both sides of this inequality yields $4.90s + 11.60l \geq 980 - 4.90l + 11.60l$, or $4.90s + 11.60l \geq 980 + 6.70l$.

Therefore, $10x$ represents the number of hours the apprentice has enrolled in on-site training courses, and $15y$ represents the number of hours the apprentice has enrolled in online training courses. Since $x$ is the number of on-site training courses and $y$ is the number of online training courses the apprentice has enrolled in, $10$ is the number of hours each on-site course takes and $15$ is the number of hours each online course takes. Subtracting these numbers gives $15 - 10$, or $5$ more hours each online training course takes than each on-site training course.",5,

Line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line $j$?,"The correct answer is $\frac{3}{17}$. It's given that line $j$ is perpendicular to line $k$ in the xy-plane. This means that the slope of line $j$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $k$. The equation of line $k$, $y = -\frac{17}{3}x + 5$, is written in slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line. It follows that the slope of line $k$ is $-\frac{17}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of a number is $-1$ divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of $-\frac{17}{3}$ is $\frac{3}{17}$ or $3 \div (-\frac{17}{3})$. Thus, the slope of line $j$ is $\frac{3}{17}$.

At first I was continually trying to explain, by Japanese standards, all the queer things that came every day before my surprised eyes; for no one seemed to know the origin or significance of even the most familiar customs, nor why they existed and were followed.

The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at first, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces.

A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O’Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text? the case of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study. studies of the effects of posture on cognition. O’Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem. about the effects of posture on cognition.","Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a ""case in point"" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition.   Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem.

Based on the model, what is the height, in feet, of the object above the ground 10 seconds after being launched?","Choice C is correct. It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, $a, b, \text{ and } k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = h$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = ax^2 + h \cdot x + k$ yields $f(x) = ax^2 + 8 \cdot a \cdot x + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = ax^2 + 8 \cdot a \cdot x + 1,034$ yields $10 = 0 + 8 \cdot 0 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f(x) = -16x^2 + 8 \cdot a \cdot x + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f(10) = -160 \cdot 10 + 970$. Therefore, based on the model, $10$ seconds after being launched, the height of the object above the ground is $970$ feet.

Adding $2x^2$ and $-9x$ to both sides of this equation yields $2x^2 - 9x + \frac{c}{2} = 0$.

It's also given that the model estimates the population was 57 thousand in 1991, 224 thousand in 2011, and $x$ thousand in 2015. The change in the population between 2011 and 1991 is $224 - 57$, or 167, thousand. The change in the number of years between 2011 and 1991 is $2011 - 1991$, or 20, years.

It's given that the window repair specialist charges $\$220$ for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. Let $r$ represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since it's given that $x$ is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression $rx - 2r$. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for $x$ hours of repair is $f(x) = 220 + rx - 2r$. It's given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is $\$400$. Substituting 5 for $x$ and 400 for $f(x)$ into the equation $f(x) = 220 + rx - 2r$ yields $400 = 220 + r(5) - 2r$ or $400 = 220 + 3r$.

This generalization is exemplified by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted.

The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the ﬂowers are largely from the same species— they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of ﬂowers the bees encounter are homogeneous. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter ﬂower patches that are not rich in species, not if the ﬂowers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if ﬂowers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the ﬂower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the ﬂower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the ﬂowers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense ﬂower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.",B,"{'A': 'depleted', 'B': 'homogeneous', 'C': 'immature', 'D': 'dispersed'}"

FABRY: One Robot can replace two and a half workmen. The human machine, Miss Glory, was terribly imperfect. It had to be removed sooner or later. BUSMAN: It was too expensive.

In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more eﬃcient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering.” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces.

Although in some contexts, “answers” can mean defends against criticism, or justifies, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the opinion that Fabry expresses is that human workers can no longer fulfill the requirements of modern workplaces, not that they have ceased to justify those requirements or to defend them against criticism; indeed, there is no suggestion in the text that workers ever defended those requirements.",D,"{'A': 'Explains', 'B': 'Rebuts', 'C': 'Defends', 'D': 'Fulfills'}"

It's given that data set A consists of the heights of 75 buildings and has a mean of 32 meters. This can be represented by the equation $\frac{x}{75} = 32$, where x represents the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data set A. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 75 yields $x = 75 \times 32$, or $x = 2400$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the buildings in data set A is 2,400 meters. It's also given that data set B consists of the heights of 50 buildings and has a mean of 62 meters. This can be represented by the equation $\frac{y}{50} = 62$, where y represents the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data set B. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 50 yields $y = 50 \times 62$, or $y = 3100$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the buildings in data set B is 3,100 meters. Since it's given that data set C consists of the heights of the 125 buildings from data sets A and B, it follows that the mean of data set C is the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data sets A and B divided by the number of buildings represented in data sets A and B, or $\frac{2400 + 3100}{125}$, which is equivalent to 44 meters.

Substituting $x$ for $s$ in $s^2$ yields $x^2$. It follows that the area of square B is $x^2$. It’s given that square A has side lengths that are $166$ times the side lengths of square B. Since $x$ represents the length of each side of square B, the length of each side of square A can be represented by the expression $166x$.

","Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.

Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is.

Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments ﬂowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments ﬂowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it ﬂows into lakes than when it ﬂows out of lakes.

The graph displays data on the power conversion eﬃciency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor’s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion eﬃciency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion eﬃciency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more eﬃcient than those applied though traditional spin coating.

Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest- performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion eﬃciency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn’t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating promises greater eﬃciency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does.

A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists’ livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert. Text 2 Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara’s desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn’t exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation.

Sun.","Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text’s discussion of André Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues’ computer simulations of our solar system’s development. The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth’s real size, it’s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring’s formation was important in determining Earth’s eventual size. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn’t indicate that this was an initial simulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted    before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring’s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets’ eventual size in the researchers’ simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring’s formation affected the size of the planets.

Indeed, these series of ﬂashes are so unique that fireﬂies can use them to find other members of their species.

What is the maximum number of boxes this truck can tow in a trailer with a weight of $500$ pounds if each box weighs $120$ pounds?","Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that the truck can tow a trailer if the combined weight of the trailer and the boxes it contains is no more than $4,600$ pounds. If the trailer has a weight of $500$ pounds and each box weighs $120$ pounds, the expression $500 + 120b$, where $b$ is the number of boxes, gives the combined weight of the trailer and the boxes. Since the combined weight must be no more than $4,600$ pounds, the possible numbers of boxes the truck can tow are given by the inequality $500 + 120b \leq 4,600$. Subtracting $500$ from both sides of this inequality yields $120b \leq 4,100$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $120$ yields $b \leq \frac{4100}{120}$ or $b$ is less than or equal to approximately $34.17$. Since the number of boxes, $b$, must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes the truck can tow is the greatest whole number less than $34.17$, which is $34$.

Choice B is incorrect. Towing the trailer and $35$ boxes would yield a combined weight of $4,700$ pounds, which is greater than $4,600$ pounds.

Choice C is incorrect. Towing the trailer and $38$ boxes would yield a combined weight of $5,060$ pounds, which is greater than $4,600$ pounds.

Choice D is incorrect. Towing the trailer and $39$ boxes would yield a combined weight of $5,180$ pounds, which is greater than $4,600$ pounds.

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe- inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers’ claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic    behavior. The text doesn’t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn’t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn’t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers’ claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true—that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn’t have any bearing on the researchers’ claim about people behaving altruistically.

Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a   drop in life satisfaction.  However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively.

The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there.

The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise.

The text first provides Alice’s reﬂections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel’s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be eﬃciently arranged.

It's given that the graphs of the equations in the given system intersect at exactly one point, $x, y$, in the $xy$-plane. Therefore, $x, y$ is the only solution to the given system of equations. The given system of equations can be solved by subtracting the second equation, $y = 3x + a$, from the first equation, $y = 2a^2 - 21x + 64$. This yields $y - y = 2a^2 - 21x + 64 - 3x + a$, or $0 = 2a^2 - 24x + 64 - a$. Since the given system has only one solution, this equation has only one solution. A quadratic equation in the form $rx^2 + sx + t = 0$, where $r, s$, and $t$ are constants, has one solution if and only if the discriminant, $s^2 - 4rt$, is equal to zero. Substituting $2$ for $r$, $-24$ for $s$, and $-a + 64$ for $t$ in the expression $s^2 - 4rt$ yields $-24^2 - 4(2)(-a + 64)$. Setting this expression equal to zero yields $-24^2 - 4(2)(-a + 64) = 0$, or $8a + 64 = 0$. Subtracting $64$ from both sides of the equation yields $8a = -64$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$ yields $a = -8$. Substituting $-8$ for $a$ in the equation $0 = 2a^2 - 24x + 64 - a$ yields $0 = 2a^2 - 24x + 64 + 8$, or $0 = 2a^2 - 24x + 72$. Factoring $2$ from the right-hand side of this equation yields $0 = 2(a^2 - 12x + 36$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $0 = a^2 - 12x + 36$, which is equivalent to $0 = (- x - 6)^2$, or $0 = x + 6$.

It follows that in the expressions $0.36x^2 + 0.63x + 1.17$ and $4ax^2 + 7ax + 13a$, the coefficients of $x^2$ are equivalent, the coefficients of $x$ are equivalent, and the constant terms are equivalent. Therefore, $0.36 = 4a, 0.63 = 7a$, and $1.17 = 13a$. Solving any of these equations for $a$ yields the value of $a$. Dividing both sides of the equation $0.36 = 4a$ by 4 yields $0.09 = a$.

It's given that a line with equation $2y = 4.5$ intersects a parabola with equation $y = -4x^2 + bx$, where $b$ is a positive constant, at exactly one point in the $xy$-plane. It follows that the system of equations consisting of $2y = 4.5$ and $y = -4x^2 + bx$ has exactly one solution. Dividing both sides of the equation of the line by 2 yields $y = 2.25$. Substituting $2.25$ for $y$ in the equation of the parabola yields $2.25 = -4x^2 + bx$. Adding $4x^2$ and subtracting $bx$ from both sides of this equation yields $4x^2 - bx + 2.25 = 0$.

Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation in the $xy$-plane and $0,b$ is the y-intercept. For the first equation, $5x + 7y = 1$, subtracting $5x$ from both sides gives $y = -\frac{5}{7}x + 1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $7$ gives $y = -\frac{5}{7}x + \frac{1}{7}$.

For the second equation, $ax + by = 1$, subtracting $ax$ from both sides gives $y = -ax + 1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $b$ gives $y = -\frac{a}{b}x + \frac{1}{b}$. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, $-\frac{a}{b}$, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, $-\frac{5}{7}$.

Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields $y = -\frac{10}{7}x + 1$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}$. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in Choice B is $-\frac{10}{7}$ and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is $\frac{1}{2}$.

But train travel starts to need more “lead time” when the trains approach their capacity limits. This suggests that train companies should add more trains for these routes if they want to encourage travelers to take a train instead of a plane. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses “long-haul routes” for either air travel or rail travel, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only mentions these procedures to explain why the “lead time” is so long for air travel. It never suggests that trains need to start implementing these procedures too. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported.

An equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, has no real solutions if and only if its discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, is negative. Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of the equation $x(kx - 56) = -16$ yields $kx^2 - 56x = -16$. Adding 16 to each side of this equation yields $kx^2 - 56x + 16 = 0$.

Since the equation $f(x) = 330.4^{x+3}$ doesn't display the value 21.12, the equation defining $f$ doesn't display the maximum value of $f$. \newline Substituting 0 for $x$ in the equation defining $g$ yields $g(0) = 330.16(0.4)^0$, which can be rewritten as $g(0) = 330.16_1$ or $g(0) = 330.16$, which is equivalent to $g(0) = 33$. Therefore, the maximum value of $g$ is 33. Since the equation $g(x) = 330.16(0.4)^{-2}$ displays the value 33, the equation defining $g$ displays the maximum value of $g$.

How many cells per milliliter will there be 15 hours after the initial observation?","Choice D is correct. Let $y$ represent the number of cells per milliliter $x$ hours after the initial observation. Since the number of cells per milliliter doubles every 3 hours, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $y = ab^{x/k}$, where $a$ is the number of cells per milliliter during the initial observation and the number of cells per milliliter increases by a factor of $b$ every $k$ hours.

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length and all three angles have a measure of $60^\circ$. The height of the triangle, $k\sqrt{3}$, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the $60^\circ$ angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of $k\sqrt{3}$, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each $30^\circ$ angle has a length of $k$ and each hypotenuse has a length of $2k$. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is $2k$. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is $624$, therefore, $2k + 2k + 2k = 624$, or $6k = 624$.

Which equation best represents this situation, where $x$ is the number of months after the whale was born and $y$ is the length, in cm, of the whale?","Choice $D$ is correct. It's given that the length of the whale was $162$ cm when it was born and that its length increased an average of $4.8$ cm per month for the first $12$ months after it was born. Since $x$ represents the number of months after the whale was born, the total increase in the whale's length, in cm, is $4.8 \times x$, or $4.8x$. The length of the whale, $y$, in cm, can be found by adding the whale's length at birth, $162$ cm, to the total increase in length, $4.8x$ cm.
